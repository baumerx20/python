Losing is personal. Not just accepting blame for a loss, It is personally claimed... taking the burden off other teamates: I messed up, this was my fault, I need to be better.

Yet when we win, it is never personal, never about one person, I is never said. Because the win is shared. In other sports it's me me me, in hockey its we. Because it's a team.
